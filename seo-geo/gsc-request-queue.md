# GSC request-indexing queue — daniel-fox.com

Worked by the scheduled task `gsc-request-indexing-daniel-fox` (every 2 days,
~10/day quota — quota is per-property, separate from danielchristopherfox.com).
Property: **Domain** `sc-domain:daniel-fox.com` in Search Console
(account danielchristopherfox@gmail.com). Console URL:
https://search.google.com/search-console?resource_id=sc-domain%3Adaniel-fox.com

Per URL: inspect first. If "URL is on Google" → mark `[i]` indexed (no request).
If not indexed → REQUEST INDEXING → mark `[x]` with date. On "Quota Exceeded"
stop the run and leave the rest for next time. When every line is `[x]` or `[i]`,
disable the scheduled task and note completion here.

Baseline 2026-07-22 (Page indexing report, last update 7/9/26): 4 indexed,
29 not indexed — 26 "Discovered - currently not indexed" (never crawled),
1 "Crawled - currently not indexed", 2 "Page with redirect" (www/http variants,
harmless), 0 errors. Sitemap (32 URLs) submitted and clean; robots.txt clean.
All 32 sitemap URLs are queued below — inspection sorts out the already-indexed
ones for free (marking `[i]` costs no quota).

## Run log

- 2026-07-22: queue created from Page indexing report + sitemap.xml (32 URLs).
- 2026-07-22 (live session): 7 requested, 2 found already indexed and marked [i]
  (fractional-cmo-vs-full-time-marketing-director, do-i-need-a-cmo-for-my-small-business).
  8th request click (what-we-run.html) hit "Quota Exceeded" — cap was 7 today, not 10;
  that URL was NOT submitted, left unchecked. Note: fractional-b2c-cmo.html inspected
  as "URL is unknown to Google / no referring sitemaps" despite being in sitemap.xml —
  GSC's sitemap state may be stale; consider resubmitting sitemap.xml in the Sitemaps
  report if more URLs show this.
- 2026-07-23 (scheduled run): 0 requested. First request click (what-we-run.html,
  inspected "Discovered - currently not indexed") hit "Quota Exceeded" immediately —
  the quota appears to be a rolling ~24h window and yesterday's 7 requests hadn't
  aged out at this run time. URL left unchecked for next run.
- 2026-07-25 (scheduled run): 1 requested (what-we-run.html — confirmed "Indexing
  requested"). 2nd request click (who-its-for.html, "Discovered - currently not
  indexed") hit "Quota Exceeded" — effective cap was 1 today. That URL was NOT
  submitted, left unchecked. Note: what-we-run.html inspected as "URL is unknown to
  Google / No referring sitemaps detected" while who-its-for.html correctly showed
  https://daniel-fox.com/sitemap.xml as its referring sitemap — GSC's per-URL sitemap
  state is inconsistent; worth resubmitting sitemap.xml in the Sitemaps report.
  Quota is clearly much tighter than 10/day on this property; consider running the
  task daily rather than every 2 days, since each run may only land 1-2 requests.
